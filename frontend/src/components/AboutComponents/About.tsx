      Our team created a website as part of our learning journey into web development using React and Django. The main purpose of this website is to replace the manual list we currently use for our events, which keeps track of the performance order. By moving this process online, weâ€™ve aimed to make it more efficient and organized, allowing users to sign up digitally and view their position in the performance lineup in real-time. This project has been a great way to build our skills in both front-end and back-end development, while creating a useful tool for event management.
